3 WHY



*1 STANDARD


*1.1 TOC
	
Looks like the table of contents above, put an * and 0 at the top
so people can use find to go to the table of contents.
	

*1.2 SPACES

1 between title and whatever and any other info u wanna give
1 between heading and content,
2 between bottom of content and next title,
3 underneath and above table of content.


*2 HOW

Imagine you need to go to STANDARD; you use find (sometimes ctrl-f) and type
the number before STANDARD but put an * before it. 


*3 WHY

It looks snazzy no matter the width of the document.
