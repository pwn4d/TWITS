*1 STANDARD


*1.1 TITLE N STUFF

You don't need two titles like what I did, the RELEASE and 
UPDATED doesn't need to exist, you can do what you want!!!!


*1.2 TOC
	
Looks like the table of contents above, put an * and 0 at the top
so people can use find to go to the table of contents.
	

*1.3 SPACES

1 between title and other info you want to declare,
1 between heading and content,
2 between bottom of content and next title,
3 underneath and above table of content.


*2 HOW

You can use find (sometimes ctrl-f) and type
the number before STANDARD with an * before it.


*3 SOFTWARE

I am currently making an awk file called "twits" which checks
if the file you provide it has any UNCERTIFIED TWITS THINGS.


*4 TODO

Finish twits to point where it matches standard,
think about if standard is even the correct word for this,
make an examples folder to show people why my shit isn't
complete suck.
